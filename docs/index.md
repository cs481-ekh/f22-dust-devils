## Abstract:
To support the capability of quantifying Martian dust devils atmospheric influence on Mars's climate, we plan to implement and improve the open source Muldoon python package. This package already has a model in place and our goal is to improve the efficiency of this existing algorithm and create more algorithms for the remaining measurements to inform us of the impact dust devils have on Mars. The models we will be implementing are the wind time series, dust signal time series. Our main goals for this project will be to add PDS4 compatibility (format used by NASA to store and distribute planetary data), improve the packages documentation, and implement wind speed time series model to the Muldoon Python package. This work could lead to Muldoon being a helpful tool for other scientists and engineers who have to analyze rover data and the effects of dust devils on Mars’s climate.

## Project Description:
The goal of project was adapting and upgrading a previously constructed python package, Muldoon designed to analyze martian meteorological data. Planned upgrades included reconfiguring python package to read PDS4 data, dust devil wind timeseries model, and improving the package documentation.
